# O que é Rails?

"Rails is a **web application development framework** written in the Ruby
language. It is designed to make programming web applications easier by making
assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to
**write less code** while accomplishing more than many other languages and
frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web
application development **more fun**."

**Don't Repeat Yourself:** "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."

**Convention Over Configuration:** Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.
